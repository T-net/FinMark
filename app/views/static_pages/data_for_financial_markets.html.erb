            <p>
              Data is the new oil. Big data, small data, structured data, unstructured data, demand side data, supply side dataâ€¦ we live in a data rich world. With this data ecosystem, being so abundant and our research questions more complex than ever before, we can no longer rely only on limited traditional Financial Inclusion (FI) data solutions. A plethora of new data sources is now available while, at the same time, traditional data collection methods are becoming prohibitively expensive. Serious questions about the quality and relevance of this research are also being raised.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Data for Financial Markets programme was established to address these new data opportunities and challenges. about the quality and relevance of this research It houses our new and improved gold standard FinScope Consumer and MSME survey offering. A suite of new products, that include a low cost mobile data collection capability, Geospatial (GIS) solutions, a data portal housing numerous FI data sets and an Analytics capability than can generate insights from all data sources, including Big Data form part of this.

              The proliferation of mobile devices has presented researchers with a golden opportunity to rethink the way data is collected. Mobile surveys are not soon going to replace traditional Demand Side Surveys (DSS) , but do provide us with options to track important market metrics regularly and to understand emerging phenomena. Mobile generated insights can then be explored further using tailored DSS surveys or experimental methods. Advantages of Mobile:

                <p>This is achieved by overlaying GIS information on themes such as:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Infrastructure information â€“ road networks, financial and other infrastructures;</li>
                  <li>Population and demographic information;</li>
                  <li>Risk related data â€“ meteorological, crime and other;</li>
                  <li>Economic activity.</li>

                </ul>


                <p>This approach is of benefit to different stakeholders:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Regulatory authorities are able to understand the distribution infrastructure within their jurisdiction and, importantly, to identify populations that are either inadequately served or over-served.</li>
                  <li>FSPs are able to identify locations for the distribution of their services. Once identified, providers also leverage this approach to conduct a viability analysis of these locations to ensure that the supporting infrastructure is in place. Finally, providers in the insurance and credit space draw on geographic risk information for both product development and pricing.</li>

                </ul>


                <p>The use of GIS allows us to:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Produce official country statistics on specific access points, such as Bank Branches, ATMs, mobile money agents etc;</li>
                  <li>Understand drivers of usage of financial access points;</li>
                  <li>Effectively enforce KYC rules relating to agent banking;</li>
                  <li>Better inform financial sector infrastructure development, e.g. where best to place additional access points, thereby increasing access;</li>
                  <li>Contribute to the Global Goals adopted by the UN cost effectively</li>
                  <li>Critical analysis of the effects of central bank policies;</li>
